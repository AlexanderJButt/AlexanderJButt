Hi all,

I am currently studying an applied information technology degree at Whitecliffe in New Zealand.
At the same time, I am working for a company called Beers doing sales and general management.

Best reached by email.

Fun fact: I love snow sports, the best way to enjoy one of the more average seasons.
